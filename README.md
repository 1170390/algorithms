# _Algorithms_

This is a bug-reporting site for my _Algorithms_ textbook and other related course materials.

**To report an error, please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/jeffgerickson/algorithms/pulls).**
* For an error in the book, please include the chapter, section, and page numbers.
* For an error in the lecture notes, please include the title and *a complete URL* of the note in question.  There are _lots_ of old revisions floating around the web, with inconsistent numbering.

However, _before_ reporting an error, please check that it hasn't already been fixed in the most recent revision.

While you're here, please feel free to download a complete copy of the most recent revision of the book.

### Additional Materials

The book contains only a small subset of my course materials; you can find hundreds more pages of lecture notes, lab handouts, and past homeworks and exams at  http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms, or at the mnemonic shortcut http://algorithms.wtf.  You can see the material in context at the web sites for my most recent offerings of [CS 374](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs374/sp2018/A) and [CS 473](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs473/sp2017) at Illinois.

At some future date, I am likely to incporporate more (but defeinitely not all) of these lecture notes into a future edition.  (I haven't decided whether I'm going to call it a "director's cut" or an "extended dance remix".)  One step at a time.
