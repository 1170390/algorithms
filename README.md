# Algorithms FTW!

This is an evolving draft of an algorithms textbook, tentatively entired _Algorithms FTW!_, provided here specifically to atract bug reports and other feedback before publication.  I expect to self-publish the textbook in late 2018.  Don't worry, an electronic version of the book will always be freely available.

This is a small subset of the lecture notes available at http://algorithms.wtf, or at the web sites for my most recent offerings of [CS 374](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs374/sp2018/A) and [CS 473](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs473/sp2017) at Illinois.  At some future date, I'm likely add some or all of those notes to this site.  I may even eventually incorporate some of those notes into _Algorithms: TFW your book gets a lot longer_.  One step at a time.
